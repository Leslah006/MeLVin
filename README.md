## Introduction
MeLVin-MEta Language for VIsualization, a meta-declarative language and a graphical framework to design interactive 
and coordinated views applications for visualization.  Our framework is an abstraction layer placed over existing visual
grammars and visualization declarative languages, providing them with interoperability mechanisms. 
The main contribution of this research is to provide a user-friendly system to design visualization and processing 
cards that can be interconnected to form data analysis workflows. Cards and workflows can be saved, distributed and 
reused between users.
